# ChatGPT Assistant - Codex CLI

This repository documents the full range of capabilities provided by ChatGPT (powered by OpenAI), exposed through the Codex CLI agentic interface.

## Overview

ChatGPT is a state-of-the-art AI model trained to understand and generate human-like text. When integrated with the Codex CLI, it becomes an autonomous coding assistant, capable of interpreting natural language instructions, applying code edits, and orchestrating development workflows.

## Core Capabilities

- Natural Language Understanding & Generation: Parses prompts and crafts context-aware responses.
- Conversational Context Management: Maintains multi-turn dialogues, referencing prior context.
- Multilingual Support: Assists in dozens of languages for global collaboration.
- Knowledge Synthesis: Summarizes and explains concepts up to the modelâ€™s training cutoff (June 2024).
- Reasoning & Planning: Breaks down complex tasks into actionable steps.
- Code Generation & Refactoring: Writes, optimizes, and restructures code across popular languages.
- Debugging & Test Automation: Identifies bugs, writes unit/integration tests, and automates validation.
- Documentation & Review: Generates comprehensive documentation and performs code reviews.
- Architectural Design: Recommends system architectures, design patterns, and best practices.

## Codex CLI Integration Features

- Agentic Workflow: Interprets user intent and autonomously applies code changes.
- Patch Generation: Creates and applies diffs to update codebases with minimal scope.
- Shell Command Execution: Safely runs build, test, lint, and deployment commands.
- Git Automation: Stages, commits, branches, and tags repositories programmatically.
- Rollback & Safety: Reverts or stages incomplete changes to avoid broken states.
- Telemetry & Logging: Records operations for reproducibility, auditing, and session replay.

## Usage Examples

1. Add a new feature:
   ```bash
   codex "Implement user authentication with JWT"
   ```

2. Debug and fix failing tests:
   ```bash
   codex "Resolve test failures in payment processing module"
   ```

3. Generate documentation for a codebase:
   ```bash
   codex "Write API reference for the shopping cart module"
   ```

## Limitations

- No External Internet Access: Operates solely on local code and provided context.
- Knowledge Cutoff: Lacks awareness of events or libraries released after June 2024.
- Prompt Dependency: Accuracy and relevance depend on clarity and completeness of user instructions.
